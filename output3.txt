- KeywordGroup
  - Chosen LLM-domain: Natural Language Processing
  - Simulated Domain: Data Structure
  - Reasoning: KeywordGroup likely deals with grouping keywords for processing natural language data.

- SearchQuery
  - Chosen LLM-domain: Search
  - Simulated Domain: Natural Language Processing
  - Reasoning: SearchQuery implies a class that handles queries for searching, often involving natural language understanding.

- String
  - Chosen LLM-domain: Language
  - Simulated Domain: Utility
  - Reasoning: String is a fundamental language feature used across various utilities.

- BibDatabaseMode
  - Chosen LLM-domain: Databases
  - Simulated Domain: Application
  - Reasoning: BibDatabaseMode likely refers to different modes of operation within a bibliographic database application.

- UnknownField
  - Chosen LLM-domain: Error Handling
  - Simulated Domain: Data Structure
  - Reasoning: UnknownField may represent a field not recognized by the system, which is related to error handling in data structures.

- HtmlToLatexFormatter
