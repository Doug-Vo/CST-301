Please note that for some methods like `insertEntry`, `setField`, `isSimilar`, `addParameter`, `setType`, and `getImportFormatPreferences`, I've used `CustomClass` as a placeholder since these methods are not part of the standard Java API and could belong to any custom class created for specific purposes. The context and topics for these are hypothetical and based on the general utility these methods might offer.
